TODO
	check thumbnail creation
	rest/raptor/pub-sub external interface
		zip up results
	check out execution of darknet software

	DONE
		authors: Balasundram Arunn, Chatura Samarasinghe, Reed McCauley
		add MIT license
		help page with versioning
		accuracy score - compare to what - shown on event lines
		cleanup rmm debug statements
		mypy used for static code analysis
		video_url removal
		use mp4-frame-size.py to show total number of frames while processing
		put stream (rtsp) read timeout: default 60 secs
		refactor Multiprocess_python.py name
		overall result status - seems to be missing from json

For RTSP - do we want to {stream-some} {do some work} {repeat} OR {stream all} {do all work}
Javascript Weapon_detection.js tries 10 times to execute embedded Python

How important is this:
	# comment out below line to enable tensorflow outputs
	#os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'

What's satisfying this import. 
	NOTE: pip list, conda list doesn't show it
	import multiprocessing

relative/absolute path stuff - paths are relative using "."
	read_class_names
	import // core and data to wepcore and wepdata

DONE - Deprecate NoOfProcesses

rename python_function

VIDEO_LINK or FILE_NAME - pick one
remove rmm comments

Integrate relative path info (from config.py). others. are they used?
